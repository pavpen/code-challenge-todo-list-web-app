# To-do List Demo

This is an implementation of a coding challenge for a Web application that
provides a to-do list.

More details of the challenge are in
[fullstackassessment/README.md](fullstackassessment/README.md).

* The frontend is served by a Node server.
* The backend is served by a Java server using Spring Boot.
* There's no database server.  Data is stored in memory, and is lost when the
  backend terminates.
